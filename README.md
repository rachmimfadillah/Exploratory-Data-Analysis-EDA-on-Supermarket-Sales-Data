# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Supermarket-Sales-Data

<b> Project Description </b>

The goal of this simple project is to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset of supermarket sales. The dataset includes information such as Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer Type, Gender, Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, Date, Time, Payment, COGS, Gross Margin Percentage, Gross Income, and Rating.

<br />

<b> Installation </b>

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries and packages:

pandas <br>
numpy <br>
matplotlib <br>
seaborn

<br />

<b> Data Cleaning and Preprocessing </b>

Before performing the EDA, I cleaned and preprocessed the data by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and converting data types where necessary.

<br />

<b> Exploratory Data Analysis </b>

I used visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data. Some of the key findings are:

- The Average Gross Margin Percentage by Branch <br>
- The Total Revenue Over Time (between 2019-01-01 and 2019-04-01) <br>
- The Total Sales by Customer Type for Each Gender <br>
- The Total Sales by Product Line

<br />

<b> Conclusion </b>

In conclusion, this EDA project provided valuable insights into the customer behavior of an online retailer. Some of the key findings are:

- After conducting a thorough analysis of the dataset, it has been observed that the average gross margin percentage for each branch is consistent and equal to 4.76. This finding suggests that there is no significant variation in the profitability of each branch with regard to gross margin percentage <br>
- Based on the analysis of the dataset, it has been determined that during the period spanning from March 1st, 2019 to March 15th, 2019, the supermarket experienced the highest growth in total revenue <br>
- The customer type with the highest frequency and largest total sales was "Member". Additionally, the gender with the highest frequency and largest total sales was found to be "Female". When considering customer type by gender, "Female" had the highest total sales among both "Normal" and "Member" customer types. These findings suggest that "Member" customers and female customers in general may be particularly important segments for the business to focus on in terms of driving revenue <br>
- The "Food and Beverages" product line had the highest total sales. As such, it is recommended that the company prioritize efforts to increase sales within this product line in order to optimize profitability
